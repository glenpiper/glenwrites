## Compromised Account (Outlook Rules) Script/Process

### Please ensure that you:


- Walk the client through changing their password; <mark>*(Make sure they are in front of a computer and confirm the password change before you get off the phone)*</mark>;

- Instruct the client on identifying and not falling prey to phishing attempts;

- Recommend/Encourage the client – if they are an SHSU employee – to contact HR and Payroll, and verify their information with them <mark>*(To make sure nothing was changed)*</mark>;

- Access their Outlook <mark>*(Remoting in via Bomgar as needed)*</mark> and delete any and all rules that are filtering/deleting messages:

	- Get a screencap of the rules; <mark>*(Do this FIRST)*</mark>
	- Remove any/all rules that are deleting messages;

- Verify that the client’s off-site contact info has not changed; <mark>*(If so, show them where to go to change it back)*</mark>

- Strongly recommend they review the security on their personal (non-SHSU) accounts:

	> E.g., *"It would be a good idea for you to check your important personal accounts (banking, credit card, utilities, etc.), particularly if you used your SHSU email account as a primary or secondary address. Changing your passwords on those accounts is highly recommended, as is employing the strongest security measures made available by the account provider (e.g., Two Factor Authentication)"*

- Contact IT Security with all the information that you’ve collected so that they can begin their work. <mark>*(Create a ticket, document the info you collected)*</mark>
