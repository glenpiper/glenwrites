**1. ADHERENCE TO POLICIES, PROCEDURES, AND RULES:**

    **Consider the employee's knowledge and understanding as related to individual's internal control responsibilities.**

    **5 - Exceeds** -  Has completely mastered knowledge of policies, procedures, and rules
    **4 - Above** - Knowledge of policies, procedures, and rules is frequently above that expected
    **3 - Acceptable** - Has an adequate knowledge of policies, procedures, and rules
    **2 - Below** - Understanding of policies, procedures, and rules is somewhat below normal expectations
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Has a minimum understanding of policies, procedures, and rules

    **Weight:** 10%

    Selected: 3

    **Comments:**

    Norma continues to be a tremendous source of knowledge about the past development of policies & processes - i.e., original intent and how things might have evolved over time to get into a current state. This knowledge is often key in identifying and understanding current gaps, and how to begin addressing them. Norma can sometimes get frustrated when (cooperative/consensus-driven) new process/procedure development takes longer than expected.

    **Consider the employee's manner, disposition or orientation exhibited in daily efforts.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Has a positive and encouraging attitude and makes a positive contribution to morale

    **2 - Below** - Lacks a positive attitude towards work environment
    **1 - Does Not Meet** - Often argumentative; considered unreceptive and antagonistic

    **Comments:**

    Norma takes a great deal of pride in her work. Not only does she want to positively represent the group, department, division, and university with her work, but she also is driven to ensure that the work done by the Service Desk, Client Services, and IT@Sam positively represents her. These are both highly commendable motivations. Her positive attitude about the Service Desk, its staff, and the work we do reveals itself in how she cares about each individual, both personally and professionally. This has a positive impact on overall morale.


**3. EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION:**

This motivation guides her and helps her work well with clients of all types, even when things get difficult.

    **Comments:**

    On the whole, Norma is a pleasure to work with. At times, however, generally when she gets frustrated with the pace of a process, a decision is made that she disagrees with, or the owner/steward of something doesn't share her sense of urgency, Norma does not react in a constructive manner. The frustration manifests itself in a focus on an immediate need for a policy and/or a question/placement of blame about why testing/documentation wasn't done/produced (in the moment, determining the best way to provide support is needed, not a post-mortem). A byproduct of this can also be a relentless focus on either badgering the owner/steward to do their work/updates (and how/what to do), or to make a push to just do it ourselves because the clients need it & the SD has to know what to do/tell them. This directive tone and mindset has, over time, led to many reports of discomfort with communication from (and a desire to avoid working with) Norma.


**6. JOB KNOWLEDGE:**

    **Consider employee’s knowledge of duties, responsibilities of position, and how the employee applies technical knowledge, education, and experience to job requirements.**

    **5 - Exceeds** - Has completely mastered job; strives to learn more/improve job skills
    **4 - Above** - Understands all phases of work; most job duties mastered
    **3 - Acceptable** - Has adequate grasp of job requirements; is able to learn new aspects of job
    **2 - Below** - Lacks knowledge of some phases of work

    Norma is disciplined and professional in her prioritization and time management skills. I can count on her to make good decisions as well as to ask for direction/advice when she needs it.

    Norma's work output is strong. She produces a lot (e.g., QA reviews of student tickets and call recordings, knowledge articles, etc.) and can be counted on to get more challenging tasks like the initial Local Admin Users Account audit coordinated and completed.
